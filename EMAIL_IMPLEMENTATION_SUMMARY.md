## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `nodemailer` - Email sending library

### Environment Variables Required
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Email Service Configuration
- **Gmail SMTP** (default, easily configurable for other services)
- **App password authentication** for security
- **HTML email support** with inline CSS
- **Error handling** and logging

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: When a user registers, the system creates their account
2. **Email Trigger**: After successful account creation, the welcome email is triggered
3. **Non-blocking Send**: Email is sent asynchronously without affecting registration speed
4. **User Experience**: User gets immediate registration confirmation while email is sent in background
5. **Logging**: All email attempts are logged for monitoring and debugging

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install nodemailer`
2. **Set up Gmail app password** (see EMAIL_SETUP.md)
3. **Configure environment variables** in `.env` file
4. **Test the functionality** using the test endpoint

### Testing
- **Test endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/test-email`
- **Test script**: `node test-email.js`
- **Preview**: Open `email-preview.html` in browser
